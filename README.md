#TODO:

This is a list of what I still need to do:

- Auto download movies on my IMDB.com watchlist.
- Auto start plexhometheater on PC boot (not working at the moment).
- Shutdown PC when the "shutdown" option is selected on PLEX.
- Get remote control working with PLEX (on ubuntu), TV and amplifier.
